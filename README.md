# House Price Prediction

The "House Price Prediction" project focuses on predicting housing prices using machine learning techniques. By leveraging popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn (sklearn), Matplotlib, Seaborn, this project provides an end-to-end solution for accurate price estimation.

## Project Overview

The "House Price Prediction" project aims to develop a model that can accurately predict housing prices based on various features. This prediction task is of great significance in real estate and finance, enabling informed decision-making for buyers, sellers, and investors. By employing machine learning algorithms and a curated dataset, this project provides a powerful tool for estimating house prices.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection and Processing:** The project utilizes the "Bangalore Housing" dataset, which can be directly downloaded from the Scikit-learn library. The dataset contains features such as house age, number of rooms, population, and median income. Using Pandas, the data is processed and transformed to ensure it is suitable for analysis.

- **Data Visualization:** The project employs data visualization techniques to gain insights into the dataset. Matplotlib and Seaborn are utilized to create visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices. These visualizations provide a deeper understanding of the relationships between features and help identify trends and patterns.

- **Train-Test Split:** To evaluate the performance of the regression model, the project employs the train-test split technique. The dataset is split into training and testing subsets, ensuring that the model is trained on a portion of the data and evaluated on unseen data. This allows for an accurate assessment of the model's predictive capabilities.

- **Regression Model using DecesionTree:** This project utilizes DecisionTree to build a regression model. Decision trees are effective in capturing non-linear relationships and handling both numerical and categorical data. The Scikit-learn library provides an implementation of DecisionTreeRegressor, which is used in this project to achieve accurate and interpretable predictions.

- **Model Evaluation:** This project implements a regression model evaluation using GridSearchCV to compare multiple machine learning algorithms. By leveraging Linear Regression, Lasso, and Decision Tree models, the evaluation process conducts hyperparameter tuning through 5-fold cross-validation, generating performance metrics including Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
